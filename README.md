# Full-Stack Authentication System

A robust and secure user authentication system built for modern web applications. This project provides a complete and production-ready solution for managing user accounts, including registration, secure login, password resets, and email verification. It's a great starting point for any full-stack project requiring user management.

### ‚ú® Features

- **User Registration:** Securely create new user accounts.
- **Secure Login:** Authenticate users with password hashing (`bcryptjs`) and secure tokens (`jsonwebtoken`).
- **Email Verification:** New users must verify their email with a unique, one-time-use link sent to their inbox.
- **Password Reset:** Users can securely reset their password via a one-time-use email link.
- **Protected Routes:** A protected profile page accessible only to logged-in users.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean, mobile-friendly user interface built with Tailwind CSS.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Email Service:** MailerSend
- **Authentication:** `bcryptjs` and `jsonwebtoken`
- **HTTP Client:** `axios`

***

### üöÄ How It Works

This is a full-stack application where the frontend and backend are seamlessly integrated within a single Next.js project.

- **Registration & Login:** The frontend forms send data to dedicated API routes (e.g., `/api/users/signup`), where the backend handles password hashing and user creation or authentication.
- **Email Verification & Password Reset:** The backend generates a secure, one-time token and stores it in the database with an expiry time. The token is then used to construct a unique URL that is sent to the user via a beautiful email template powered by **MailerSend**.
- **User Profile:** Upon successful login, the frontend stores the user's authentication token and uses it to access protected API routes, such as `/api/users/me`, to fetch and display their data.
